# Dynamic Agent Creation System

## Overview
The codebase has been updated to create new AI agents on-the-fly based on task requirements. The system includes a **final MasterReviewer** using GPT-5 with high reasoning effort for comprehensive synthesis and quality assurance. Instead of relying solely on predefined static agents, the system now intelligently analyzes each task and generates specialized agents when existing expertise is insufficient.

## Key Components

### 1. DynamicAgentFactory (`src/core/DynamicAgentFactory.ts`)
- **Core engine** for creating and managing dynamic agents
- **Persistent storage** using SQLite database for agent reuse
- **Agent evolution** based on performance feedback
- **Team collaboration** orchestration for multiple agents

Key features:
- `analyzeAgentNeeds()`: Determines if new agents are required
- `createAgent()`: Generates new specialized agents using AI
- `evolveAgent()`: Improves agents based on feedback
- `createAgentTeam()`: Orchestrates multi-agent collaboration

### 2. ExpertRegistry (`src/core/ExpertRegistry.ts`)
- **Unified registry** for both static and dynamic experts
- **Intelligent selection** based on task analysis
- **Gap identification** to find missing expertise areas
- **Hybrid teams** combining static and dynamic agents

Key methods:
- `selectExperts()`: Chooses appropriate experts for a task
- `identifyMissingExpertise()`: Finds gaps in coverage
- `createDynamicExperts()`: Fills gaps with new agents

### 3. Enhanced ModeInference (`src/core/ModeInference.ts`)
- **Dynamic round planning** that incorporates new agents
- **Adaptive execution** based on task complexity
- **Seamless integration** of dynamic agents into workflow

### 4. MasterReviewer - Final Quality Gate
- **GPT-5 High Reasoning**: Uses maximum reasoning effort for deep analysis
- **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Combines all expert contributions into coherent whole
- **Quality Assurance**: Identifies gaps, contradictions, and optimization opportunities
- **Mode-Specific Focus**: 
  - `PR mode`: Implementation validation, code quality, requirements coverage
  - `Design Review`: Design coherence, architectural soundness, optimization
  - `Explore mode`: Creative synthesis, breakthrough identification, vision creation

Key benefits:
- Catches issues individual experts might miss
- Ensures coherence across diverse expert contributions  
- Provides final optimization and quality validation
- Acts as safety net for complex multi-agent workflows

## How It Works

### Agent Creation Flow
1. **Task Analysis**: System analyzes the incoming task to understand domains and requirements
2. **Gap Detection**: Identifies expertise areas not covered by existing agents
3. **Dynamic Generation**: Creates new specialized agents using LLM prompts
4. **Prompt Enhancement**: Refines agent prompts for better performance
5. **Team Formation**: Combines static and dynamic agents into collaborative teams
6. **Round Execution**: All experts contribute their specialized knowledge
7. **Final Synthesis**: MasterReviewer (GPT-5 High) performs comprehensive review and optimization
8. **Persistent Storage**: Saves successful agents for future reuse

### Example Scenarios

#### Gamification Task
```
Task: "Design a gamification system for a language learning app"
→ System detects need for "engagement mechanics" expertise
→ Creates: GamificationSpecialist with reward system knowledge
```

#### Real-time Collaboration
```
Task: "Build a real-time collaborative whiteboard"
→ System detects need for "WebSocket" and "conflict resolution"
→ Creates: RealtimeSpecialist with streaming expertise
```

#### Accessibility Focus
```
Task: "Redesign checkout flow for full accessibility"
→ System detects need for "WCAG compliance" expertise
→ Creates: AccessibilityArchitect with screen reader optimization
→ MasterReviewer: Validates accessibility compliance across all designs
```

#### Full Workflow Example
```
Task: "Build a gamification system with real-time features"

1. Static Experts: DesignPhilosopher, SystemsTheorist, EffectArchitect
2. Dynamic Agents Created: 
   - GamificationSpecialist (engagement mechanics)
   - RealtimeArchitect (WebSocket management)
3. Round Execution: Each expert contributes specialized knowledge
4. MasterReviewer Final Analysis:
   ✓ Validates gamification mechanics align with real-time architecture
   ✓ Identifies performance bottlenecks in reward calculation
   ✓ Suggests caching strategy for leaderboard updates  
   ✓ Ensures user experience remains smooth during peak loads
   ✓ Recommends specific testing strategies for edge cases
```

## Database Schema

Dynamic agents are persisted with:
- **Identity**: id, name, domain
- **Capabilities**: expertise areas, capabilities list
- **Performance**: usage_count, success_rate
- **Context**: task_context, creation timestamp

## Agent Evolution

Agents improve over time through:
1. **Performance tracking**: Success rates and usage patterns
2. **Feedback incorporation**: Learning from task outcomes
3. **Prompt refinement**: Enhanced system prompts based on experience
4. **Version management**: Creating evolved versions of successful agents

## Benefits

1. **Adaptability**: Handles novel tasks requiring unique expertise
2. **Efficiency**: Reuses successful agents across similar tasks
3. **Scalability**: Grows expertise library automatically
4. **Intelligence**: Self-improving system through evolution
5. **Flexibility**: Combines predefined and dynamic expertise

## Testing

Run the test suite to see dynamic agents in action:
```bash
bun run src/examples/testDynamicAgents.ts
```

This demonstrates:
- Dynamic agent creation for various task types
- Agent reuse and caching
- Team collaboration strategies
- Agent evolution based on feedback

## Integration Points

The dynamic agent system integrates with:
- **OpenAI Service**: For agent generation and enhancement
- **Mode Inference**: For adaptive round planning
- **Expert Registry**: For unified expert management
- **Memory Bank**: For storing successful patterns

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Agent specialization trees (hierarchical expertise)
- Cross-task agent learning
- Agent capability certification
- Multi-model agent generation
- Agent marketplace/sharing
